The CIA Triad

The CIA Triad is the heart of information security. Let’s break down each part:

a. Confidentiality

Ensures that only authorized users can access the data.

Protects data from being viewed by unauthorized people.

Example:
When you log in to your bank account, your password ensures only you can see your balance — that’s confidentiality.

How it’s achieved:

Passwords, biometrics, and encryption.

Access control lists (ACLs) and data classification.

Scenario:
Imagine an employee leaves a laptop with customer data in a coffee shop. If it’s encrypted, even if someone steals it, they can’t read it — confidentiality is preserved.

b. Integrity

Ensures that data is accurate and not tampered with.

No one should modify or delete data without authorization.

Example:
If someone tries to change your online banking balance from ₹1,000 to ₹10,000, the system should detect and prevent it.

How it’s achieved:

Hashing (MD5, SHA-256)

Digital signatures

Backups and version control

Scenario:
A hacker modifies a medical report to change test results. The hospital uses digital signatures — the mismatch reveals tampering. ✅ Integrity protected.

c. Availability

Ensures that data and services are accessible whenever needed.

Protects systems from downtime or denial of access.

Example:
When you visit Amazon during a sale, the website must remain up and running — that’s availability.

How it’s achieved:

Redundant systems, backups, load balancing

DDoS protection and maintenance monitoring

Scenario:
A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack floods a company’s server with traffic, taking it down. Strong firewalls and content delivery networks (CDNs) maintain availability.

| Term              | Meaning                                                             | Example / Scenario                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Threat**        | A potential danger that can exploit a weakness.                     | Hackers trying to steal data from a bank.             |
| **Vulnerability** | A weakness in a system that can be exploited.                       | Using an outdated operating system or weak passwords. |
| **Weakness**      | A design or configuration issue that might lead to a vulnerability. | Not updating antivirus regularly.                     |
| **Exploit**       | Actual code or method that takes advantage of a vulnerability.      | A hacker uses a “zero-day exploit” to bypass login.   |
| **Payload**       | The malicious part of an attack that causes harm.                   | A ransomware’s payload encrypts all your files.       |

Scenario Example:

Threat: Hacker plans to attack a hospital network.

Vulnerability: The hospital uses outdated software.

Exploit: Hacker uses a known exploit to break in.

Payload: Installs ransomware and encrypts files.

CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)

Definition:
CVE is a public list of known cybersecurity vulnerabilities maintained by the MITRE Corporation.
Each vulnerability is given a unique CVE ID (like CVE-2024-12345).

Purpose:
It helps security experts share information about known vulnerabilities so organizations can fix them.

Example:

CVE-2021-44228 — Log4j vulnerability, which affected millions of servers worldwide.

Scenario:
A company scans its systems for CVE-listed issues and patches them to prevent attacks. This is called vulnerability management.

CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)

Definition:
CWE is a catalog of software weaknesses — the root causes of vulnerabilities.

While CVE lists specific instances of vulnerabilities, CWE focuses on categories of weaknesses that lead to vulnerabilities.

Example:

CWE-79: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

CWE-89: SQL Injection

Scenario:
A developer writes unsafe code like:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ' " + userInput + " ';


This can lead to SQL Injection (CWE-89).
Understanding CWEs helps developers write secure code.

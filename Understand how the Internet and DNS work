What Happens When You Type google.com in Your Browser

Let’s break it into a real-world, step-by-step sequence.

🧠 Step 1: Browser Checks Cache (DNS Lookup Starts)

Before your browser can open google.com, it needs to know its IP address, because the Internet works on IPs — not names.

So your browser first checks:

Browser Cache — has the IP been recently resolved?

Operating System Cache — your computer’s internal DNS memory.

Router Cache — your home router may have cached DNS results.

ISP’s DNS Resolver — your Internet Service Provider’s DNS server.

If none of them know the IP, the DNS resolution process begins.

🌐 Step 2: DNS (Domain Name System) — “The Internet’s Phonebook”

DNS translates domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses (like 142.250.190.78).

Let’s see how this happens 👇

🧭 Step 3: DNS Resolution Process (Deep Dive)

When your system needs the IP for google.com, it queries step-by-step:

Root DNS Server

First, the resolver contacts one of the 13 root DNS servers.

The root server doesn’t know “google.com” but tells where to find .com domains.

TLD (Top-Level Domain) DNS Server

Next, it asks the .com TLD server.

This server replies: “Ask Google’s authoritative name server.”

Authoritative DNS Server

Finally, your resolver asks Google’s own DNS server.

It replies with the actual IP address for google.com.

Then the resolver returns this IP to your browser, which caches it for future use.

⚡ Step 4: Browser Connects to Google’s Server

Now that your browser has the IP address (say 142.250.190.78), it does the following:

TCP Handshake (if HTTP)

Browser and server establish a connection (SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK).

TLS Handshake (if HTTPS)

The browser and server exchange encryption keys.

Secure communication is established (using SSL/TLS).

HTTP Request

Your browser sends a request:

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: google.com


Server Response

The server sends back HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.

Your browser renders the page you see as “Google.”

⚙️ Step 5: Rendering the Web Page

Your browser’s rendering engine (like Blink in Chrome or Gecko in Firefox) takes the data from the server and:

Builds the DOM (Document Object Model).

Loads styles (CSS) and scripts (JavaScript).

Displays the final web page visually.

How Search Engines Work (e.g., Google Search)

Now that you’re on Google, what happens when you search something, say, “cybersecurity”?

Let’s go step-by-step again 👇

🧠 Step 1: Crawling (Data Collection)

Search engines use automated programs called Web Crawlers or Spiders (like Googlebot).

These bots:

Visit billions of web pages.

Follow links on each page.

Download and store page content.

Discover new pages continuously.

Example:

Googlebot crawls “example.com”, finds a link to “example.com/about”, and visits that too.

🗂️ Step 2: Indexing (Organizing Data)

The crawled content is analyzed and stored in a massive index (like a digital library).

For each page, Google stores:

Keywords and phrases

Page title, URL, and structure

Images and alt text

Freshness (when last updated)

PageRank (how trustworthy/popular it is)

This index is constantly updated.

⚙️ Step 3: Ranking (Determining Order of Results)

When you search something, Google doesn’t search the web live —
it searches its index and ranks results based on hundreds of factors (algorithms).

Some major ranking factors:

Relevance — how well the page matches your search query.

Authority — backlinks and domain trust.

User Experience — loading speed, mobile-friendliness.

Freshness — how recent the page is.

Location & Personalization — results tailored to your area or history.

🚀 Step 4: Displaying Search Results (SERP)

The Search Engine Results Page (SERP) shows:

Organic results (from ranking algorithm)

Paid results/ads

Snippets, videos, maps, etc.

🔁 Step 5: Continuous Optimization

Search engines constantly refine their algorithms using:

Machine learning

User feedback (clicks, dwell time)

AI models like Google’s RankBrain
